Hi, I'm Vinzenz, a recent AI graduate interested in leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems. I'm passionate about artificial intelligence, data engineering, machine learning, and data science.
I will showcase some of my work here in the time to come.


#### About Me

I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence from Radboud University.
My journey has been a combination of academic rigor and hands-on experience, enabling me to tackle complex problems and deliver practical solutions.
Whether it's developing predictive models, implementing natural language processing algorithms, or getting to know deep learning, I'm always eager to push the boundaries of what's possible in the AI realm.
At Oliva Advisory, I am implementing data engineering solutions in Azure. I have learned so much already, and am excited to see what the future holds for data engineering and AI.
